1. First I clean the data by dropping every unnecessary variable, 
before splitting the time column into three columns, containing day, month, and year.

2. Then I sum up all passengers for each day of each day, and goup them by day.

3. Excluded passengers aboard in the independent variable

4. Run the training and plot

I actually have no idea why my results come out this weird, with Accuracy Score = 0.0,
and the confusios matrix not being a 2x2 matrix. Both the independent av dependent variable are very tidy.
